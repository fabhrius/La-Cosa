Can a computer uncover answers to unravel the mysteries of life?

Such enigmas as:

What constitutes life?
Why does all of this occur?
What is unfolding?

Who am I?
Why am I here?
Why is mortality inevitable?
Could I potentially be crafted for a significant purpose, thus brought into being?
Have I, in this realm, fulfilled my mission?

Could an intelligence conceivably exist with the capacity to intricately design every living being?
And if so, where might this intelligence reside?

Many of us grapple with these types of questions throughout our lifetimes.

The narrative within these pages broadly outlines a theoretical computer model.
One that, perhaps, could offer insight into certain aspects.
A computer model that we will delve into meticulously, put to the test, observe in action, and dissect in terms of its salient features.

Yet, we'll also be delving into life and our own existence.
While the primary content falls under the purview of computer science,
this account is meant for all individuals, devoid of any prerequisite knowledge for comprehension.
