#### Climax

Elara resumed her journey, heading west through the forest. The sun began to set, casting long shadows on the forest floor. She walked briskly, knowing she had only a couple of hours of light left.

As she walked, her thoughts drifted back to her grandmother. "It would be a great help to have her now, in this forest," she thought wistfully. Suddenly, she saw a figure moving through the forest ahead, a silhouette she recognized. Her heart raced, and a shiver ran through her body.

"Grandma, is that you?" she called out, her voice trembling with hope and fear. The figure moved away quickly, disappearing behind the trees. Desperate, Elara ran after it, tears streaming down her face.

"Grandma, don't go!" she screamed, feeling the pain of loss all over again. "Grandma, don't leave me!"

The ghostly silhouette of her grandmother turned behind a tree and vanished into the thick vegetation.

In this part she remembers her grandmother and an illusion appears in her sight.
the figure of her lost grandmother and the hope of being with her again.
she tries desperately to get her lost grandmother back without success. This piece of writing should reflect her feelings of helplessness, despair, sadness and should be written in a highly dramatic style.

You can add descriptions of the wood, the evening coming and the shadows to make it more mysterious and dramatic.
