#### Cliffhanger

Elara ran with all her might, her legs pumping furiously. She jumped over a fallen tree trunk, but on the other side, there was no ground. She plunged down a ten-meter drop into a river that flowed below.

You can add whatever you want here to create the atmosphere we need to keep the reader looking forward to the next episode.
Action, suspense, and drama.

The reader should think that this is the end of Elara.
And we want them to be eager to read the next chapter to find out more about Elara's fate.
