#### Cliffhanger

Elara's heart pounded in her chest as she tore through the forest, her breath coming in ragged gasps. The undergrowth snagged at her clothes, branches whipped at her face, but she didn’t slow down. The forest, once a maze of shadows and whispers, now seemed to blur into a dark tunnel, her only focus on escaping the ghostly visions that haunted her. She could still hear her grandmother’s voice, echoing in her mind, urging her onward, yet deep inside, she knew it was just a cruel trick of the forest.

Suddenly, her foot caught on a twisted root, and she stumbled forward, barely catching herself. As she regained her balance, she saw it—a massive, fallen tree trunk blocking her path. There was no time to think. She gathered all her strength and leaped, her body sailing through the air. For a brief, exhilarating moment, she felt weightless, as if she might actually escape the nightmare.

But on the other side, there was nothing. No ground, no solid footing—just open air. Elara’s eyes widened in horror as she realized too late what lay ahead. The world seemed to slow as she fell, the wind whipping past her, her arms flailing in a desperate attempt to grasp onto anything. But there was nothing to hold onto, nothing to stop her descent.

She plummeted down a sheer drop, the cold night air rushing around her, before she crashed into the river below. The impact was brutal, the icy water closing over her in an instant, pulling her down into its dark, unforgiving depths. The shock of the cold stole her breath, and the relentless current grabbed her, dragging her further beneath the surface.

Elara fought to swim, her arms and legs thrashing wildly in the murky water. She struggled to break free from the river’s grip, to reach the surface and the precious air above. But the current was too strong, pulling her down, down into the abyss. Her lungs burned, screaming for oxygen, but no matter how hard she fought, she couldn’t break free. The darkness of the water swallowed her whole, the weight of it pressing down on her, smothering her.

Above, the owl perched on a branch overlooking the river, its eyes wide with alarm. It called her name, its voice cutting through the night like a beacon of hope. "Elara, Elara!" But the river's roar drowned out its cries, the sound of rushing water filling the air as if the forest itself was mourning her loss.

Elara’s vision blurred, her strength fading. She could feel herself being pulled further into the depths, the light above growing dimmer with each passing second. Panic gripped her heart, and in that moment, she truly believed this was the end. Her body grew heavy, her movements sluggish as her will to fight ebbed away. The world became a swirl of darkness and cold, her senses dulling as consciousness began to slip from her grasp.

The owl’s desperate calls grew fainter, until they were nothing but distant echoes in the back of her mind. The river, relentless and unforgiving, consumed her completely, and Elara disappeared beneath the water, leaving nothing but ripples on the surface.

The forest fell silent, a haunting stillness settling over the scene. The owl, now alone, watched the river intently, but no sign of Elara emerged. The air hung heavy with suspense, the silence almost unbearable. Had the forest claimed her, just as it had her grandmother’s image? 

The moon rose higher in the sky, casting a pale light over the forest, but the river remained dark, mysterious, and silent—its secrets hidden beneath the cold, unforgiving water. 

And so, the chapter ends, leaving only the question: will Elara rise again?



----------------------------



Elara sprinted through the forest, her breath coming in ragged gasps, her eyes locked on the fleeting figure of her grandmother. The ghostly silhouette seemed so real, so close, as if it could vanish at any moment. "Grandma, wait!" she cried out, desperation lacing her voice. But the figure only moved faster, slipping between the trees like a shadow.

Branches whipped at Elara's face, the undergrowth clawing at her legs, but she pushed on, driven by a frantic need to reach the woman who had once been her world. Her heart pounded in her chest, a wild rhythm of fear and hope, as she raced after the phantom through the darkening forest.

Suddenly, the ground beneath her feet gave way. She had been so focused on the figure ahead that she hadn’t seen the drop—a sheer cliff concealed by the thick underbrush. Elara barely had time to gasp before she was falling, her arms flailing, trying to grasp onto anything to stop her descent.

She hit the river with a bone-jarring impact, the icy water closing over her in an instant. The shock of the cold was like a thousand needles piercing her skin, and the current wasted no time in grabbing hold of her, dragging her down into its dark, swirling depths. Panic surged through her as she struggled to swim, her muscles burning with the effort, but the river was too strong, its pull relentless.

Above the water, the forest continued its eerie silence, as if the entire world had paused to watch her struggle. The figure of her grandmother was nowhere to be seen, vanished as if it had never been there at all. Elara's heart sank as she realized she had been chasing an illusion, a cruel trick of the forest that had led her to this deadly trap.

The river roared around her, its icy fingers pulling her deeper into the abyss. Her lungs screamed for air, but every time she fought to reach the surface, the current dragged her back down. The light above grew fainter, the cold seeping into her bones, numbing her limbs, sapping her strength.

From a branch high above, the owl watched in alarm, its eyes wide with fear. It called her name, its voice a beacon of hope in the darkness. "Elara, Elara!" But the river’s roar drowned out its cries, the water swallowing her desperate gasps as she fought to stay afloat.

But Elara’s strength was fading. Her vision blurred, and the world around her became a swirl of darkness and cold. She could feel herself slipping away, the icy water closing over her head, pulling her down into the depths. The last thing she saw was the owl, its eyes wide with desperation as it called her name one final time.

Then, everything went black. The river claimed her, leaving the forest in a haunting, eerie silence.
