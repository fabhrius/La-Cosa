#### Background

As Elara wandered through the enchanted forest, her mind drifted back to a simpler time, when life was filled with the warmth of her grandmother Mag’s love and wisdom. In her mind’s eye, memories began to surface, transporting her to a different time and place. She was a little girl again, running barefoot through her grandmother's garden on a bright spring morning, the world around her bathed in golden sunlight. The garden was a sanctuary of vibrant colors and sweet scents, with wildflowers blooming in every corner and the gentle sound of the Main River flowing nearby.

Mag, with her wise, wrinkled face and kind eyes, was always nearby, tending to the herbs she grew or cooking over a small campfire near the riverbank behind their house. The little house where they lived was nestled beside a bend in the Main River of Rainland, a place where the water curved gently, almost as if embracing the land. The river was a constant companion to Elara, its soothing whispers and playful ripples a backdrop to her childhood adventures.

Mag was more than just a grandmother to Elara; she was her entire world. Known throughout the village for her kindness, generosity, and intelligence, Mag was the person people turned to for advice and comfort. She had a way of making everyone feel special, as if they were the most important person in the world. For Elara, she was not only a caregiver but also a teacher, mentor, and friend. Mag was committed to giving Elara the best life she could, instilling in her the values of kindness, curiosity, and strength.

Elara's childhood was a happy one, filled with laughter, learning, and the freedom to explore the world around her. Mag encouraged her to think freely, to question everything, and to seek out her own path in life. She taught Elara how to be brave, to face challenges head-on, and to overcome her own limits. Whether it was climbing the tallest tree in the garden or standing up to the older children in the village, Mag always urged Elara to believe in herself.

One morning, while the scent of freshly baked bread wafted through the air, Elara had been pretending to be a fairy, waving a small branch she imagined was a magic wand. She danced around the garden, casting made-up spells, her imagination running wild.

“Are you a fairy?” Mag had asked with a smile, watching her from where she knelt beside a patch of lavender.

“I am a forest fairy,” little Elara had replied with conviction, her eyes sparkling with delight.

“Mmm, I see it now,” Mag said thoughtfully, as she wiped her hands on her apron. “Do you know? There is an enchanted forest in Rainland that can only be reached with the imagination. Few people have seen it, but it exists, and it is as real as this river and the great mountain. That is where fairies like you belong.”

Elara had listened in awe, her young heart swelling with wonder at the thought of such a place. The idea of an enchanted forest, hidden away from the world and filled with magic, had stayed with her ever since. It became a part of her dreams, a secret hope that one day she might find it.

Now, standing in this very forest, Elara felt a deep connection to that memory. It was as if the forest had been waiting for her all along, calling out to her through the stories Mag had shared. The sense of wonder and nostalgia filled her chest, mingling with the anxiety and fear of the unknown. Was this the very forest Mag had spoken of? Had her journey been leading her here from the very beginning?

The memory faded, leaving Elara with a sense of awe. She was no longer the little girl playing in her grandmother’s garden, but the spirit of that child lived on in her heart, guiding her through the mystery and magic of the enchanted forest.
